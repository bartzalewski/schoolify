# schoolify - the first globalized electronic diary for schools

This is my first ReactJS project. It will contain things like school's news feed, list of grades, upcoming tests, homework and a lesson plan. Feel free to view my code.

## What kind of technologies did I use?

- I wanted to make my styles "better, faster, stronger" using styled-components. We'll see how it goes. ðŸ¤”

## How to run?

1. `cd schoolify`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
